{"name":"G6080 — Scientific computing","tagline":"Code and write-ups for Stefan Countryman's G6080 homework assignments","body":"### Source Code\r\n\r\nSource code is available on the master branch, or by rooting around in the subdirectories of these pages. Most of it is written in Julia, but there is some stuff, especially early on, that was implemented in MATLAB. I highly recommend using Julia over MATLAB, Python, or C++. See below for links that I found helpful:\r\n\r\n* [An excellent and comprehensive guide to setting up Julia, complete with iJulia notebooks like I used](http://quant-econ.net/jl/getting_started.html) (you can skip the stuff about DataFrames)\r\n* [Julia's official documentation—not worth reading all at once, but usually the best troubleshooting reference](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.3/)\r\n\r\n### Write Ups\r\n\r\nHere are links to the write ups for each of the five homework assignments (subject to update—see the master branch for full histories if, for some bizarre reason, they're of any interest to you):\r\n\r\n* [Set 1](http://www.stefancountryman.com/g6080/set01/sci-comp-hw-1-stefan.html)\r\n* [Set 2](http://www.stefancountryman.com/g6080/set02/sci-comp-hw-2-stefan.html)\r\n* [Set 3](http://www.stefancountryman.com/g6080/set03/sci-comp-hw-3-stefan.html)\r\n* [Set 4](http://www.stefancountryman.com/g6080/set04/sci-comp-hw-4-stefan.html)\r\n* [Set 5](http://www.stefancountryman.com/g6080/set05/sci-comp-hw-5-stefan.html)\r\n","google":"UA-62819400-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
