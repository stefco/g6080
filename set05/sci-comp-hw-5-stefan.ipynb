    "Here, $\\rho$ is zero except at $\\vec{x} = (0.5 + a/2, 0.25 + a/2)$, where it equals $2\\delta(\\vec{x})$. Since we're including points along the border, the distance between neighboring grid points is $h = 1/N$. We can express the discretized Laplacian, acting on the $N^2$-vector of potentials on the grid, as:\n",

    "\n",
    "We have inhomogenous boundary conditions ($\\phi = 10$) for the rectangle centered at (0.625, 0.75) and homogenous boundary conditions along the perimeter of the grid. Since these values of $\\phi$ are fixed, they cannot figure into the $\\Delta\\phi=-\\rho$ problem, in the sense that $\\rho$ cannot be fixed if $\\phi$ is held fixed (the equivalent physical analogy is the surface of a conductor in electrostatics). So for any _fixed_ $\\phi_{i}$, we can set $\\rho_{i} = 0 \\implies \\Delta_{i,j} = 0 \\ \\ \\forall \\ \\ j$. In other words, for each $i$ such that $\\phi_{i}$ is held constant, we set the $i^{th}$ row of $\\Delta$ equal to zero. This assures us that $\\phi$ only depends on $\\rho$ through the boundary conditions.\n",
